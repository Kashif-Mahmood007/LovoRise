                4. PURCHASES
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you subscribe to our service, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel it. The specific terms and conditions of auto-renewal will be clearly presented to you at the time of purchase. <br><br>
                By purchasing a subscription, you agree to the automatic renewal of your subscription until you decide to cancel. If you choose to cancel your subscription, you will continue to enjoy all subscription benefits until the end of the current billing cycle. After this period, your subscription will expire, and you will no longer have access to the subscription benefits. <br>
                You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings. Refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the subscription term. <br><br>

                <span class="weight550">Billing and Payment</span> <br><br>

                All subscription fees are billed on a recurring basis, according to the billing cycle specified at the time of purchase. Payment will be charged to your chosen payment method at the confirmation of purchase. If a payment fails, access to subscription benefits may be suspended until payment is successfully processed. <br><br>

                <span class="weight550">Coins and Other Virtual Items</span> <br><br>

                You may have the option to purchase a limited, personal, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable license to use "virtual objects," such as Lovo Coins, periodically (collectively, "Virtual Items"). The amount of Virtual Items displayed in your account does not represent a real-world balance or stored value but rather indicates the extent of your license. <br>
                Virtual Items do not expire due to non-use; however, the license granted to you for Virtual Items will terminate if LovoRise ceases to provide the Service or if your account is closed or terminated, as per the terms of this Agreement. <br>
                LovoRise reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to charge fees for access to or use of Virtual Items, and/or to distribute Virtual Items for free or for a fee. <br>
                LovoRise has the authority to manage, regulate, control, modify, or remove Virtual Items at any time. If LovoRise exercises any of these rights, it has no obligation to you or any third party. Virtual Items can only be redeemed through the Service. ALL PURCHASES AND REDEMPTIONS OF VIRTUAL ITEMS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. The provision of Virtual Items for use in the Service begins upon your purchase of such Virtual Items. <br>
                YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT LOVORISE IS NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL ITEMS WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER VOLUNTARILY OR INVOLUNTARILY.

            </h2>
            <p>
                LovoRise prohibits users from engaging in any exchanges, transactions, or monetary dealings with other users on the platform. This includes but is not limited to the exchange of money, gifts, services, or any other items of value. LovoRise explicitly disclaims any responsibility or liability for exchanges or transactions between users. Users are urged to use caution and avoid participating in any activities that involve the transfer of money or valuable items. Users are encouraged to report any user attempting or soliciting such exchanges to LovoRise immediately. Engaging in these activities may result in the suspension or termination of the user's account. By using LovoRise, you acknowledge and agree that LovoRise is not responsible for any exchanges or transactions between users, and you assume full responsibility for any consequences that may arise from such interactions.

                Like many subscription-based services, there are ads on our Services. <br>
                Our Services may contain advertisements and promotions offered by third parties and links to other websites or resources. Additionally, our Services may allow you to watch an advertisement in exchange for Virtual Items; LovoRise does not guarantee that you will always be eligible to watch such advertisements, or that any such advertisements will be available. LovoRise may also provide non-commercial links or references to third parties within its content. LovoRise is not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of any external websites or resources or their content. Furthermore, LovoRise is not responsible for, and does not endorse, any products or services that may be offered by third-party websites or resources.

                Neither us nor any owner shall be liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive, including, without limitation, loss of data, income, profit, or goodwill, loss of or damage to property, and claims of third parties arising out of your access to or use of the app, site, our content, or any member content, regardless of the cause, whether based on breach of contract, tort (including negligence), infringement of proprietary rights, product liability, or otherwise.This limitation of liability applies even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages. If you are dissatisfied in any way with the app or site, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue your use of the app and site. <br><br>
                By using the app or site, you hereby waive any and all claims arising from such use. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, these provisions may not apply to you. <br>
                The limitation of liability herein is a fundamental part of the basis of the bargain and represents a fair allocation of risk. The app and site would not be provided without such limitations, and you agree that these limitations, exclusions of liability, disclaimers, and exclusive remedies shall apply even if they fail their essential purpose. This provision does not apply to liability arising from any fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or any other liability that cannot be limited under applicable law.
